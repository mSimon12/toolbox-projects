# 🧰 Toolbox Projects

A collection of small but practical tools I build while sharpening my skills in **Python**, **Go**, and **backend engineering**.

These projects are not just code snippets — they follow best practices such as:
- ✅ Logging
- ✅ Configuration management (.env, YAML, JSON)
- ✅ CLI arguments
- ✅ Clean and maintainable structure

## 📂 Projects

- **Weather Fetcher** 🌦 – Fetch weather data from an API (logging + config + CLI)  
- (more coming soon...)

## 🎯 Purpose
This repo is my **toolbox**:  
- to practice and showcase good engineering habits,  
- to share small, reusable tools with others,  
- to experiment new technologies
- and to document my journey into reliable and efficient backend systems.
